The high influx of Africans from their home countries to the diaspora has led to most of them finding themselves in countries that might warmly receive them but does not have a financial system designed for their needs due to cultural and other differences. A common issue most African immigrants might face is lack of access to credit products when they arrive in a foreign country due to lack of credit history. We observed these difficulties and set out to provide solutions.
